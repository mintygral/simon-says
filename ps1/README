Place each of your individual submodule files in a file with the submodule as the name, and ".sv" as the extension.
Eg. for ssdec, save your code in a new file called ssdec.sv.

To test a specific module, run:
- "make test_submodule"

To test all available modules, run:
- "make"

If you see errors like:
"make: *** No rule to make target 'test_ssdec'.  Stop."
It means you didn't name the submodule file correctly, or you never created it in the first place.
